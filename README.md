# Piet_Hein_Codes
These are the Python and Mathematica codes that I wrote for ploting my given Figures in the manuscript.
Four files with extension .py are python codes that are used to plot the wake with Piet Hein geometry
Other five files with extension .nb are mathematica files that are used to plot the mathematical results.
